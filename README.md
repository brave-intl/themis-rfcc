# THEMIS RFC&C

The Request For Comments and Code (RFC&C) community event is a 2 month event
where the Brave Research team, companies and projects in the cryptography space,
and researchers will come together to engage in technical discussions and
collaborations to push THEMISv2 forward towards production. The RFC&C is a great
opportunity for crypto projects and researchers to actively shape the future of
the BAT ecosystem. As we go through the various phases, we will regularly share
updates with the community and hold sessions to answer the questions that the
participating teams might have.

This repo contains resources for teams to participate in the RFC&C event:

## FAQ


- **How to participate in the RFC&C event?**

Feel free to reach out anyone at the Brave Research team on our  [RFC&C and
THEMIS technical report)](./rfcc-themis-tech-report-v0.1.pdf).

- **Should the participant teams work on all phases of the protocol?**

Not necessarily. Although we welcome submissions which tackle many aspects of
the protocol as possible, we will consider submissions that focus on specific
parts of the protocol (e.g. anonymous ad attribution, reward verification
scheme, etc). We prioritize the impact and correctness of the submissions over
completeness.

- **Should the submissions be based on the current design of the THEMISv2 protocol?**

No, the current protocol design described in this report is a starting point
and an example of a system the Brave Research Team sees as a good trade-off
between privacy, security, scalability and production-readiness. Submissions
may not use any of the components of THEMIS. However, the submissions should
respect the goals and requirements outlined in the Section Goals and Requirements
of the [RFC&C and THEMIS technical report](./rfcc-themis-tech-report-v0.1.pdf).
