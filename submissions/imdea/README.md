## IMDEA Software Institute: 

**Summary**: The IMDEA crypto research group submitted a proposal for a cryptographic scheme that allows the clients to swap the bilinear-friendly commitments of the BBA for a bilinear-free commitment. The commitment swap will make the reward proof generation, verification and batching more resource efficient, since that to use bilinear-friendly curves in a ZK circuit is expensive. The proposal consists of a non-interactive Î£-protocol to allow the user to prove that two vectors with multi-Pedersen commitments in different groups contain the same values. The non-interactiveness is achieved using fiat-shamir heuristics, to prove equality between two different groups. The near-term goal is to work on a paper and publish it in a cryptography venue.
